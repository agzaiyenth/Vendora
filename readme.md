# Ticketing System Project

## Introduction  
The Ticketing System is a robust and scalable platform designed to manage ticket distribution for events. It allows vendors to add tickets to a pool and customers to purchase them at specified rates. The system handles concurrency, ensures data consistency, and provides real-time status updates on ticket availability and sales. The platform supports the management of maximum event tickets and pool tickets, making it highly adaptable for various use cases.
